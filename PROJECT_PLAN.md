# Meeting Optimizer Add-in: Professional Project Plan

## 1. Context & Vision

Meeting Optimizer is a professional Outlook add-in designed to streamline the process of scheduling meetings between internal and external attendees, with a focus on enterprise clients (e.g., banks, law firms, consultancies). The goal is to eliminate calendar back-and-forth, handle time zones, and provide a seamless, modern user experience for busy professionals.

**Key Use Case:**
- Junior bankers/consultants/lawyers need to quickly coordinate meetings with internal teams (legal, managers) and external clients, minimizing email ping-pong and maximizing efficiency.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Security & Privacy:** Enterprise-grade authentication (SSO), minimal data storage, clear privacy documentation.
- **Professional UI/UX:** Modern, accessible, and responsive design using React and Tailwind.
- **Integration:** Deep integration with Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams), with future support for Zoom/Webex/Slack.
- **Scalability:** Designed for both small teams and large enterprises.

## 3. Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React (with Tailwind CSS for styling)
- **Add-in Integration:** Office.js (for Outlook add-in)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (API, SSO, Graph integration)
- **Authentication:** MSAL (OAuth2, on-behalf-of flow)
- **Data:** Microsoft Graph API (calendars, users, meetings)
- **Optional:** Next.js for dashboard or web portal

## 4. Phased Roadmap

### **Phase 1: MVP (Core Scheduling)**
- [x] Migrate frontend to React + Tailwind (set up new React app for the add-in UI)
- [x] SSO login and Microsoft Graph integration (DONE)
- [x] Add attendees (internal/external)
- [ ] Show available times (list + basic calendar view)
- [ ] Suggest optimal times (simple scoring, time zone handling)
- [ ] Auto-create invites
- [ ] Track responses (RSVP status)
- [ ] Professional React UI (reuse/extend example components)

### **Phase 2: Power Features**
- [ ] Team/role-based quick meetings (e.g., "legal", "managers")
- [ ] User-specified time constraints (e.g., "mornings only")
- [ ] Confidence scoring (availability overlap)
- [ ] Voting/polling for external attendees (web link/email)
- [ ] Full calendar view (week/day grid)

### **Phase 3: Enterprise & Integrations**
- [ ] Teams integration (auto-create Teams links)
- [ ] Zoom/Webex/Slack integration (stretch goals)
- [ ] Room/resource booking (stretch goal)
- [ ] Admin/config panel (settings, usage stats)
- [ ] Accessibility & compliance review
- [ ] Branding options (white-labeling)

### **Phase 4: Analytics & Go-to-Market**
- [ ] Usage analytics (time saved, meeting stats)
- [ ] Privacy/compliance documentation
- [ ] Prepare for Office Store/admin deployment
- [ ] Sales/demo materials
- [ ] Support onboarding for enterprise clients

## 5. Feature Details & Guidance

### **Attendee Management**
- Add internal users via directory search (Graph API)
- Add external users by email (with limited calendar visibility)
- Support for "teams" or "roles" (e.g., legal, managers)

### **Availability & Suggestions**
- Fetch free/busy data for all attendees (Graph API)
- Handle time zones automatically
- Allow user to specify constraints (e.g., preferred times, avoid certain days)
- Suggest optimal times with confidence score
- Show both list and calendar views

### **Meeting Creation & Tracking**
- Auto-create Outlook invites with all attendees
- Track RSVP status (Graph API)
- For external users, provide voting/polling via web/email

### **Integrations**
- Start with Teams (auto-create meeting links)
- Add Zoom/Webex/Slack as stretch goals
- Room/resource booking via Graph API (optional)

### **UI/UX**
- Use React + Tailwind for all UI
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG compliance)
- Responsive design for desktop and web Outlook
- Option for dashboard view (Next.js) in future

### **Security & Privacy**
- Use SSO and OAuth2 on-behalf-of flow (already implemented)
- Only store minimal data (busy/free, not event details)
- Document all data flows for enterprise clients

## 6. Development Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Write unit and integration tests for core logic
- Use Prettier/ESLint for code quality
- Document all components and APIs
- Use feature branches and pull requests for all changes
- Regularly review accessibility and performance

## 7. Example User Flow (MVP)
1. User opens the add-in task pane in Outlook
2. Adds required attendees (internal/external)
3. Specifies time constraints (optional)
4. Clicks "Suggest Times"
5. Sees a list/calendar of optimal times with confidence scores
6. Selects a time and sends invite(s)
7. Tracks responses in the add-in

- Use this file as the **single source of truth** for the project
- At the start of each new feature, review the relevant section
- Open new chats referencing this plan for context
- Check off completed items and update as the project evolves
